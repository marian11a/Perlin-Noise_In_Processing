# Perlin Noise
## Overview
Perlin Noise is a type of gradient noise used extensively in computer graphics, procedural content generation, and texture synthesis. Developed by Ken Perlin in 1983, it provides a more natural, organic appearance compared to simpler noise functions. Perlin Noise is widely used in applications such as terrain generation, procedural textures, and animations.

## Features
* Natural Appearance: Generates smooth, continuous noise that resembles natural phenomena like clouds, landscapes, and marble textures.
* Gradient-based: Uses gradients to produce coherent structures, avoiding the harsh randomness of white noise.
* Multi-dimensional: Can be extended to 2D, 3D, or higher dimensions, making it versatile for various applications.
* Octaves and Persistence: Supports multiple layers of noise (octaves) to create detailed, fractal-like structures.
## Applications
* Terrain Generation: Used in games and simulations to create realistic landscapes and height maps.
* Texture Synthesis: Helps in generating procedural textures for materials like wood, stone, and clouds.
* Animations: Adds organic movement to animations and special effects.
* Noise-based Filters: Used in image processing to create artistic effects or to simulate natural patterns.
